    // Okay, so something interesting
    // References to variables are stored on the stack
    // And then, when those variables go out of scope,
    // their heap is freed.
    // If two variables point to the same heap space though,
    // (which can not happen in Rust), then there can result
    // a "double free" error which can lead to data corruption.

    // but what about this:
    let a = 1;
    let b = a;
    println!("a: {}, b: {}", a, b);
    // why is this valid?
    // well, for simple data types such as ints, bools, floats,
    // and tuples of only ints, bools, and floats, the data
    // is stored directly on the stack, because we can know
    // their size before allocating.
    let c = (1, 2, 3, 4.2, true, false);
    let d = c; // valid

    assert_eq!(e, f);
    assert_eq!(e, f);
